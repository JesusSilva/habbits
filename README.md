## Description

Habbits addresses a common misconception in many nutritionist and personal trainer clinics. Most clinics still use a word, pdf or excel file to create diets and workout plans. That's why Habbits was born, to provide a dashboard where every nutritionist or trainer can keep an exhaustive control of their clients with total transparency.

Habbits aims to provide the following tools:

- To be able to schedule appointments and have these appointments sent via email to clients with all the information of the appointment.
- Keep track of weight, height, measurements and percentages of a client.
- Generate training routines.
- Generate diets according to a client's needs.
